In this lecture, which will take place on May 30, we will delve into the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs). We will focus on understanding the underlying architecture and principles of LLMs, including popular models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers. We will explore how these models are trained on vast amounts of text data to generate coherent and context-aware responses. Additionally, we will discuss the applications and challenges associated with LLMs in various natural language processing tasks.

Here is a possible rewrite in the style of President Ronald Reagan utilizing ChatGPT:
My fellow Americans, on May 30, we will embark on a journey of discovery and innovation. We will learn about the wonders of Large Language Models (LLMs), the cutting-edge technology that is transforming our world. We will understand how they are built and how they work, using models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers. We will witness how they are trained on enormous amounts of text data to create coherent and relevant responses. We will also address the opportunities and challenges that LLMs present for various natural language processing tasks. This is not just a lecture, this is a vision. And we will make it a reality.
